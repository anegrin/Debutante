ðŸŽµ Debutante ðŸŽµ
=======

A feature-rich Android music player built with Java and based on ExoPlayer. Designed to offer all the functionalities I wanted but couldn't find in other music players. Debutante is not meant to be fancy, it's meant to work.

## Features

- **Powered by ExoPlayer** for smooth and reliable playback.
- **Supports Local & Remote Music Files** via a Subsonic-compliant API server (e.g., Navidrome).
- **Organized Library**: Sorts music by Artist, then by Album.
- **Bluetooth Integration**:
  - Supports A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile).
  - Supports AVRCP (Audio/Video Remote Control Profile).
  - Autoplay on Bluetooth device connection.
- **Flexible Playback Options**:
  - Play a single album or all albums from an artist.
  - Works as an Android Auto music player.
  - Casts both local and remote music files.
  - Browse your music library from AVRCP players like car's infotainment.
- **High-Quality Audio Support**:
  - Native support for FLAC and Opus formats.
  - ExoPlayer offload support to reduce memory consumption.

## Why now?

I tested the player for several years before publishing it. This player is tied to my own needs, publishing it now for whoever wanna check the code and understand some of the "workarounds" I had to implement.

Support

I have a full time job, I won't be able to provide support; just clone it, compile it, study it...enjoy it! :)
